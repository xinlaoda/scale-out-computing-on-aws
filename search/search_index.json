The solution features a large selection of compute resources; fast network backbone; unlimited storage; and budget and cost management directly integrated within AWS. The solution also deploys a user interface (UI) and automation tools that allows you to create your own queues, scheduler resources, Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), software, and libraries. This solution is designed to provide a production ready reference implementation to be a starting point for deploying an AWS environment to run scale-out workloads, allowing you to focus on running simulations designed to solve complex computational problems. Easy installation \u00b6 Installation of your Scale-Out Computing on AWS cluster is fully automated and managed by CloudFormation Did you know? You can have multiple Scale-Out Computing on AWS clusters on the same AWS account Scale-Out Computing on AWS comes with a list of unique tags, making resource tracking easy for AWS Administrators Access your cluster in 1 click \u00b6 You can access your Scale-Out Computing on AWS cluster either using DCV (Desktop Cloud Visualization) 1 or through SSH. Simple Job Submission \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS supports a list of parameters designed to simplify your job submission on AWS . Advanced users can either manually choose compute/storage/network configuration for their job or simply ignore these parameters and let Scale-Out Computing on AWS picks the most optimal hardware (defined by the HPC administrator) # Advanced Configuration user@host$ qsub -l instance_type = c5n.18xlarge \\ -l instance_ami = ami-123abcde -l nodes = 2 -l scratch_size = 300 -l efa_support = true -l spot_price = 1 .55 myscript.sh # Basic Configuration user@host$ qsub myscript.sh Info Check our Web-Based utility to generate you submission command Refer to this page for tutorial and examples Refer to this page to list all supported parameters Jobs can also be submitted via HTTP API or via web interface OS agnostic and support for custom AMI \u00b6 Customers can integrate their Centos7/Rhel7/AmazonLinux2 AMI automatically by simply using -l instance_ami=<ami_id> at job submission. There is no limitation in term of AMI numbers (you can have 10 jobs running simultaneously using 10 different AMIs). SOCA supports heterogeneous environment, so you can have concurrent jobs running different operating system on the same cluster. AMI using OS different than the scheduler In case your AMI is different than your scheduler host, you can specify the OS manually to ensure packages will be installed based on the node distribution. In this example, we assume your Scale-Out Computing on AWS deployment was done using AmazonLinux2, but you want to submit a job on your personal RHEL7 AMI user@host$ qsub -l instance_ami = <ami_id> -l base_os = rhel7 myscript.sh Scale-Out Computing on AWS AMI requirements When you use a custom AMI, just make sure that your AMI does not use /apps, /scratch or /data partitions as Scale-Out Computing on AWS will need to use these locations during the deployment. Read this page for AMI creation best practices Web User Interface \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS includes a simple web ui designed to simplify user interactions such as: Start/Stop DCV sessions in 1 click Download private key in both PEM or PPK format Check the queue and job status in real-time Add/Remove LDAP users Access the analytic dashboard Access your filesystem Understand why your jobs are stuck in the queue Create Application profiles and let your users submit job directly via the web interface HTTP Rest API \u00b6 Users can submit/retrieve/delete jobs remotely via an HTTP REST API Budgets and Cost Management \u00b6 You can review your HPC costs filtered by user/team/project/queue very easily using AWS Cost Explorer. Scale-Out Computing on AWS also supports AWS Budget and let you create budgets assigned to user/team/project or queue. To prevent over-spend, Scale-Out Computing on AWS includes hooks to restrict job submission when customer-defined budget has expired. Lastly, Scale-Out Computing on AWS let you create queue ACLs or instance restriction at a queue level. Refer to this link for all best practices in order to control your HPC cost on AWS and prevent overspend . Detailed Cluster Analytics \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS includes ElasticSearch and automatically ingest job and hosts data in real-time for accurate visualization of your cluster activity. Don't know where to start? Scale-Out Computing on AWS includes dashboard examples if you are not familiar with ElasticSearch or Kibana. 100% Customizable \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS is built entirely on top of AWS and can be customized by users as needed. Most of the logic is based of CloudFormation templates, shell scripts and python code. More importantly, the entire Scale-Out Computing on AWS codebase is open-source and available on Github . Persistent and Unlimited Storage \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS includes two unlimited EFS storage (/apps and /data). Customers also have the ability to deploy high-speed SSD EBS disks or FSx for Lustre as scratch location on their compute nodes. Refer to this page to learn more about the various storage options offered by Scale-Out Computing on AWS Centralized user-management \u00b6 Customers can create unlimited LDAP users and groups . By default Scale-Out Computing on AWS includes a default LDAP account provisioned during installation as well as a \"Sudoers\" LDAP group which manage SUDO permission on the cluster. Automatic backup \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS automatically backup your data with no additional effort required on your side. Support for network licenses \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS includes a FlexLM-enabled script which calculate the number of licenses for a given features and only start the job/provision the capacity when enough licenses are available. Automatic Errors Handling \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS performs various dry run checks before provisioning the capacity. However, it may happen than AWS can't fullfill all requests (eg: need 5 instances but only 3 can be provisioned due to capacity shortage within a placement group). In this case, Scale-Out Computing on AWS will try to provision the capacity for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, and if the capacity is still not available, Scale-Out Computing on AWS will automatically reset the request and try to provision capacity in a different availability zone. To simplify troubleshooting, all these errors are reported on the web interface Custom fair-share \u00b6 Each user is given a score which vary based on: Number of job in the queue Time each job is queued Priority of each job Type of instance Job that belong to the user with the highest score will start next. Fair Share is is configured at the queue level (so you can have one queue using FIFO and another one Fair Share) And more ... \u00b6 Refer to the various sections (tutorial/security/analytics ...) to learn more about this solution DCV is a remote visualization technology that enables users to easily and securely connect to graphic-intensive 3D applications hosted on a remote high-performance server.* \u21a9","title":"What is Scale-Out Computing on AWS ?"},{"location":"#easy-installation","text":"Installation of your Scale-Out Computing on AWS cluster is fully automated and managed by CloudFormation Did you know?

What is AWS Backups? \u00b6 AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the back up of data across AWS services in the cloud. Using AWS Backup, you can centrally configure backup policies and monitor backup activity for AWS resources, such as Amazon EBS volumes, Amazon RDS databases, Amazon DynamoDB tables, Amazon EFS file systems. Backup Vault \u00b6 A \"Backup Vault\" is where all your backups are stored. Your vault is automatically encrypted using your Key Management Service (KMS) key and reference to your SOCA cluster ID ( soca-mycluster in this example) Backup Plan \u00b6 A \"Backup Plan\" is where you define all your backup strategy such as backup frequency, data retention or resource assignments. Backup rules (red section) \u00b6 By default, Scale-Out Computing on AWS creates one backup rule with the following parameters: Backup will start every day between 5AM and 6AM UTC (blue section) Backup will expire after 1 month (orange section) Backup is stored on the encrypted vault created by SOCA (purple section) If needed, you can edit this rule (or create a new one) to match your company backup strategy. Resources Assignments (green section) \u00b6 By default, Scale-Out Computing on AWS backup all data using the soca:BackupPlan tag. Value of this tag must match your cluster ID ( soca-mycluster in this example). Supported Resources AWS Backup only support the following resources: EC2 instances EBS disks EFS filesystems RDS (not used by SOCA) DynamoDB (not used by SOCA) How to add/remove resources to the backup plan \u00b6 Backup resources are managed by soca:BackupPlan tag. The value of this tag must match the value of your Backup Plan (by default it should match the name of your cluster). Apply this tag to any EC2 instance, EBS volumes or EFS filesystem you want to backup. How to restore a backup? \u00b6 On the left sidebar, click \"Protected Resources\" then choose the resource you want to restore This will open a new window with additional information about this resource (either EFS or EC2).

Specify the parameters (VPC, Subnet, Security Group, IAM role ...) you want to use and click \"Restore Backup\" Restore Role By default, you can only apply SchedulerIAMRole or ComputeNodeIAMRole to the EC2 resource you are restoring. If you want to restore one EC2 instance with a different role, you must edit iam:PassRole policy of your SOCA-Backup role. Make sure to use the SOCA-Backup IAM role created by SOCA during initial installation. If you want to use the default role created by AWS Backup, make sure to add iam:PassRole permission. How to delete a backup ? \u00b6 Select your vault, choose which recovery point you want to remove under the \"Backups\" section then click \"Delete\". Check the status of the backup jobs \u00b6 On the left sidebar, check \"Jobs\" to verify if your backup jobs are running correctly What happen if you delete your Cloudformation stack? \u00b6 Your backup vault won't be deleted if you have active backups in it.

What is Cognito / Oauth2 \u00b6 With Amazon Cognito , your users can sign-in through social identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and through enterprise identity providers such as Microsoft Active Directory using SAML. Amazon Cognito User Pools provide a secure user directory that scales to hundreds of millions of users. As a fully managed service, User Pools are easy to set up without any worries about server infrastructure. User Pools provide user profiles and authentication tokens for users who sign up directly and for federated users who sign in with social and enterprise identity providers. Additionally, read this link if you are not already familiar with Oauth2 workflow. How it works ? \u00b6 1: Mary has an account on her corporate LDAP or Active Directory. This account has an username (e.g mary), an email (e.g mary@company.com ) and other parameters (cost center, location ... ). She uses her account to log in to her corporate network. 2: Mary wants to access the web UI of SOCA (we assume she already has an active account on SOCA. If not, refer to this page to learn how to manage user account on SOCA ) 2.1: She can access the application by entering her SOCA LDAP username/password 2.2: She can be automatically logged in using Amazon Cognito 3: Assuming SSO is enabled, SOCA will forward the access request Cognito which will use Mary's Corporate LDAP as a Federated identity to determine if she is a valid user. This is the authentication part. 4: Mary's Corporate LDAP will check her account (e.g based on Kerberos ticket) and return a SAML token. This is the authorization part. 5: Based on the authorization results, SOCA will automatically logs Mary in or reject her request What if Mary does not have an account on SOCA? Assuming a user has a valid credential on corporate LDAP/AD but not on SOCA, Cognito will redirect the user to the default SOCA login portal. How do you determine if a user has an account on SOCA? To verify if a corporate user is active and can log in, SOCA checks whether or not this user has an account. By default, we determine the user account name is the first part of an email address. For example, if the email returned by your corporate LDAP for a given user is myuser@company.com , we will assume this user the SOCA account is myuser . If this mapping does not apply to your company, you can change it by editing /apps/soca/$SOCA_CONFIGURATION/cluster_web_ui/generic/auth.py . Create your Cognito User Pool \u00b6 Info This setup is different for each customer, refer fo the official AWS Documentaton for Cognito if needed. First, you need to configure your Cognito User Pool with your existing SAML provider . You can leave most settings by default as we won't be using any user password, custom login UI etc.. This step is optional if you already have a User Pool configured. Integrate your AD/LDAP with Cognito \u00b6 Once your User Pool is created, go to Federation > Identity Provider and choose whatever IDP you want to use (most likely SAML if you are looking to integrate your corporate LDAP) SAML integration vary based on your own corporate settings, reach out to your local IT if needed. Here are some extra links if you need more documentation related to SAML: SAML Authentication Flow Adding SAML Identity Providers to a User Pool Create a SAML Provider on Cognito Warning The only required parameters for Scale-Out Computing on AWS is the email attribute.

Amazon Cognito User Pools provide a secure user directory that scales to hundreds of millions of users. As a fully managed service, User Pools are easy to set up without any worries about server infrastructure. User Pools provide user profiles and authentication tokens for users who sign up directly and for federated users who sign in with social and enterprise identity providers.

This account has an username (e.g mary), an email (e.g mary@company.com ) and other parameters (cost center, location ... ). She uses her account to log in to her corporate network. 2: Mary wants to access the web UI of SOCA (we assume she already has an active account on SOCA. If not, refer to this page to learn how to manage user account on SOCA ) 2.1: She can access the application by entering her SOCA LDAP username/password 2.2: She can be automatically logged in using Amazon Cognito 3: Assuming SSO is enabled, SOCA will forward the access request Cognito which will use Mary's Corporate LDAP as a Federated identity to determine if she is a valid user. This is the authentication part. 4: Mary's Corporate LDAP will check her account (e.g based on Kerberos ticket) and return a SAML token. This is the authorization part. 5: Based on the authorization results, SOCA will automatically logs Mary in or reject her request What if Mary does not have an account on SOCA? Assuming a user has a valid credential on corporate LDAP/AD but not on SOCA, Cognito will redirect the user to the default SOCA login portal. How do you determine if a user has an account on SOCA? To verify if a corporate user is active and can log in, SOCA checks whether or not this user has an account. By default, we determine the user account name is the first part of an email address. For example, if the email returned by your corporate LDAP for a given user is myuser@company.com , we will assume this user the SOCA account is myuser .

EFS (shared) partitions \u00b6 /data partition \u00b6 /data is an Elastic File System partition mounted on all hosts. This contains the home directory of your LDAP users ($HOME = /data/home/<USERNAME> ). This partition is persistent . Avoid using this partition if your simulation is disk I/O intensive (use /scratch instead) /apps partition \u00b6 /apps is an Elastic File System partition mounted on all hosts. This partition is designed to host all your CFD/FEA/EDA/Mathematical applications. This partition is persistent . Avoid using this partition if your simulation is disk I/O intensive (use /scratch instead) The corresponding EFS file system is deployed with bursting Throughput mode which depends on burst credits. /apps has cron jobs that monitor the status of the cluster, scale-up and scale-down the cluster, and is also running the web application. If the cluster stays up and running for 1+ months and not much additional applications are installed under /apps, then EFS file system might run out of burst credits which could impact the web application. Starting v2.6.0, the solution deploys CloudWatch Alarms to monitor the burst credits for /apps EFS file system. When burst credits are close to be depleted, a lambda function is triggered to change the Throughput mode to provisioned at 5 MiB/sec. This increases the monthly cost of EFS by ~$30/month (for us-west-2 and us-east-1 regions). After some time, the file system would have earned enough burst credits, so the lambda function changes Throughput mode back to bursting as it is more cost effective. Click here to learn more about EFS Throughput modes FSx \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS supports FSx natively. Click here to learn how to use FSx as backend storage for your jobs . Instance (local) partitions \u00b6 Below are the storage options you can configure at an instance level for your jobs. If needed, add/remove/modify the storage logic by editing ComputeNode.sh script to match your requirements. Root partition \u00b6 By default Scale-Out Computing on AWS provision a 10GB EBS disk for the root partition. This may be an issue if you are using a custom AMI configured with a bigger root disk size or if you simply want to allocate additional storage for the root partition. To expand the size of the volume, submit a simulation using -l root_size=<SIZE_IN_GB> parameter. user@host:qsub -l root_size = 25 -- /bin/sleep 600 Result: Root partition is now 25GB user@host: lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT nvme0n1 259 :0 0 25G 0 disk \u251c\u2500nvme0n1p1 259 :1 0 25G 0 part / \u2514\u2500nvme0n1p128 259 :2 0 1M 0 part user@host: df -h / Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/nvme0n1p1 25G 2 .2G 23G 9 % / Scratch Partition \u00b6 Info It's recommended to provision /scratch directory whenever your simulation is I/O intensive. /scratch is a local partition and will be deleted when you job complete.

Refer to this link for more information about the various EBS types available. Request a /scratch partition with IO optimized disk \u00b6 To request an optimized SSD disk, use -l scratch_iops=<IOPS> along with -l scratch_size=<SIZE_IN_GB> . Refer to this link to get more details about burstable/IO EBS disks. user@host: qsub -l scratch_iops = 6000 -l scratch_size = 200 -- /bin/sleep 600 Looking at the EBS bash, the disk type is now \"io1\" and the number of IOPS match the value specified at job submission. Instance store partition \u00b6 Free storage is always good You are not charged for instance storage (included in the price of the instance) Some instances come with default instance storage . An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer and is removed as soon as the node is deleted. Scale-Out Computing on AWS automatically detects instance store disk and will use them as /scratch unless you specify -l scratch_size parameter for your job . In this case, Scale-Out Computing on AWS honors the user request and ignore the instance store volume(s). When node has 1 instance store volume \u00b6 For this example, I will use a \"c5d.9xlarge\" instance which is coming with a 900GB instance store disk. user@host: qsub -l instance_type = c5d.9xlarge -- /bin/sleep 600 Result: Default /scratch partition has been provisioned automatically using local instance storage user@host: lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT nvme1n1 259 :0 0 838 .2G 0 disk /scratch nvme0n1 259 :1 0 10G 0 disk \u251c\u2500nvme0n1p1 259 :2 0 10G 0 part / \u2514\u2500nvme0n1p128 259 :3 0 1M 0 part user@host: df -h /scratch Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/nvme1n1 825G 77M 783G 1 % /scratch When node has more than 1 instance store volumes \u00b6 In this special case, ComputeNode.sh script will create a raid0 partition using all instance store volumes available.

Scale-Out Computing on AWS will determine licenses are available and will start provision the capacity. Shortly after you submit job3 which require another 5 licenses. The first 2 jobs may not have started yet, meaning you still have 10 licenses available (even though the 10 licenses will be used by job1 and job2 as soon as they start).

Web Based Job Submission In addition of regular qsub, SOCA supports web based job submission as well as via HTTP REST API To get started, create a simple text file and name it \"job_submit.que\".

To get more information about this job, run qstat -f 3323 (or qstat -f 3323 -x is the job is already terminated). Your job will start as soon as resources are available (usually within 5 minutes after job submission) Delete a job from the queue \u00b6 Run qdel <job_id> to remove a job from the queue. If the job was running, associated capacity will be terminated within 4 minutes. Custom AWS scheduler resources (optional) \u00b6 Here is a list of scheduler resources specially designed for workloads running on AWS. The line starting with -l (lowercase L) is meant to define scheduler resources which will be used by this job. Syntax is as follow: In a script: #PBS -l parameter_name=parameter_value,parameter_name_2=parameter_value_2 Using qsub: qsub -l parameter_name=parameter_value -l parameter_name_2=parameter_value_2 myscript.sh Info If you don't specify them, your job will use the default values configured for your queue (see /apps/soca/$SOCA_CONFIGURATION/cluster_manager/settings/queue_mapping.yml ) Specify an EC2 Instance Type (optional) \u00b6 Scale-Out Computing on AWS supports all type of EC2 instance. If you don't specify it, job will use a default type which may not be optimal (eg: simulation is memory intensive but default EC2 is compute optimized) If you are not familiar with EC2 instances, take some time to review https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ If you want to force utilization of a specific instance type (and not use the default one), simply change the line and modify instance_type value #PBS -l [existing_parameters...],instance_type=**instance_type_value** Specify a license restriction (optional) \u00b6 License Mapping Please refer to /apps/soca/$SOCA_CONFIGURATION/cluster_manager/settings/licenses_mapping.yml for a list of licenses you can restrict. Contact your Administrator if your license is not available yet. If your job needs to check-out a specific license to run, you want to make sure enough licenses are available before provisioning capacity for the job. To do so, you can add a new resource which will be your license name and the number of license you need. Example: Your job will only start if we have at least 2 Synopsys VCSRuntime_Net licenses available. #PBS -l [existing_parameters...],synopsys_lic_vcsruntimenet=2 Manage your application logs \u00b6 PBS will automatically generate a .qlog file once the job is complete as shown below. #PBS -V -j oe -o **your_job_name**.qlog If you need more verbose log, we recommend you using STDERR/STDOUT redirection on your code My job is queued. What next? (AWS orchestration) \u00b6 First, let's make sure your jobs have been sent to the queue. You can run default qstat or use aligoqstat which is a custom wrapper developed for Scale-Out Computing on AWS. Web Based CLI As soon as jobs are sent to the queue, our in-house dispatcher script which will decide if the job can start based on hardware availabilities, priorities or license requirements. Run qstat -f **job_id** | grep Resource . Web Based CLI If you see stack_id or compute_node resource (under select), that means all requirements are met and capacity is being provisioned (aka: CloudFormation stack is created and capacity is being provisioned).

You can skip this section if you just want to install your customization on your AMI and let SOCA handles PBS/Gnome/System packages installation. 3.1 Pre-Install system packages \u00b6 You can pre-install the packages listed on https://github.com/awslabs/scale-out-computing-on-aws/blob/main/source/scripts/config.cfg . You will need to run yum install for: SYSTEM_PKGS SCHEDULER_PKGS OPENLDAP_SERVER_PKGS SSSD_PKGS Easy Install Copy the content of the config.cfg on your filesystem (say /root/config.cfg ) Run source /root/config.cfg Run the following commands: yum install -y $(echo ${SYSTEM_PKGS[*]}) yum install -y $(echo ${SCHEDULER_PKGS[*]}) yum install -y $(echo ${OPENLDAP_SERVER_PKGS[*]}) yum install -y $(echo ${SSSD_PKGS[*]}) Here is an example of how you can install packages listed in an array in bash. 3.2: Pre-Install the scheduler \u00b6 To reduce the launch time of your EC2 instance, it's recommended to pre-install OpenPBS. First, refer to https://github.com/awslabs/scale-out-computing-on-aws/blob/main/source/scripts/config.cfg and note all OpenPBS related variables as you will need to use them below (see highlighted lines): # Sudo as Root sudo su - # Define OpenPBS variable export OPENPBS_URL = <variable_from_config.txt> # ex https://github.com/openpbs/openpbs/archive/v20.0.1.tar.gz export OPENPBS_TGZ = <variable_from_config.txt> # ex v20.0.1.tar.gz export OPENPBS_VERSION = <variable_from_config.txt> # ex 20.0.1 # Run the following command to install OpenPBS cd ~ wget $OPENPBS_URL tar zxvf $OPENPBS_TGZ cd openpbs- $OPENPBS_VERSION ./autogen.sh ./configure --prefix = /opt/pbs make -j6 make install -j6 /opt/pbs/libexec/pbs_postinstall chmod 4755 /opt/pbs/sbin/pbs_iff /opt/pbs/sbin/pbs_rcp systemctl disable pbs Installation Path Make sure to install OpenPBS under /opt/pbs 3.3: (Optional) Pre-Install Gnome \u00b6 If you are using RHEL , run yum groupinstall \"Server with GUI\" -y If you are using Centos , run yum groupinstall \"GNOME Desktop\" -y If you are using Amazon Linux , run yum install -y $(echo ${DCV_AMAZONLINUX_PKGS[*]}) 3.4: Reboot your EC2 machine \u00b6 3.5: Make sure you do not have any libvirt of firewalld/iptables \u00b6 Post reboot, some distribution may automatically start libvirt or firewall. If that's the case you must delete them otherwise PBS won't be able to contact the scheduler. To find if you have a running libvirt, run ifconfig and check if you have virbr0 interface such as: ifconfig ens5: flags = 4163 <UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 9001 inet 10 .10.2.19 netmask 255 .255.255.0 broadcast 10 .10.2.255 inet6 fe80::8b1:6aff:fe8a:5ad8 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20<link> ether 0a:b1:6a:8a:5a:d8 txqueuelen 1000 ( Ethernet ) RX packets 81 bytes 11842 ( 11 .5 KiB ) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 92 bytes 12853 ( 12 .5 KiB ) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 lo: flags = 73 <UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING> mtu 65536 inet 127 .0.0.1 netmask 255 .0.0.0 inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 scopeid 0x10<host> loop txqueuelen 1000 ( Local Loopback ) RX packets 8 bytes 601 ( 601 .0 B ) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 8 bytes 601 ( 601 .0 B ) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 virbr0: flags = 4099 <UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 inet 192 .168.122.1 netmask 255 .255.255.0 broadcast 192 .168.122.255 ether 52 :54:00:ea:5a:b9 txqueuelen 1000 ( Ethernet ) RX packets 0 bytes 0 ( 0 .0 B ) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 0 bytes 0 ( 0 .0 B ) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 If that's the case, disable libvirt by running /bin/systemctl disable libvirtd.service ip link set virbr0 down brctl delbr virbr0 Then, make sure you do not have iptables ( iptables -L ) running. If needed, disable firewalld by running /bin/systemctl disable firewalld Step 4: Create your AMI \u00b6 Once you are done, go back to EC2 console, locate your instance and click \"Actions > Image > Create Image\" Choose an AMI name and click 'Create Image'. Your AMI is now being created. Please note it may take a couple of minutes for the AMI to be ready. To check the status, go to EC2 Console and then click \"AMIs\" on the left sidebar Stop your temporary EC2 instance Once your AMI has been created, you can safely terminate the EC2 instance you just launched as you won't need it anymore. Step 5: Test your new AMI \u00b6 # Test 1: Submit a job with a vanilla AMI $ qsub -l instance_type = c5.9xlarge -- /bin/date # Test 2: Submit a job with a pre-configured AMI $ qsub -l instance_type = c5.9xlarge -l instance_ami = ami-0e05219e578020c64 -- /bin/date Results: Test1 (Vanilla): 3 minutes 45 seconds to provision EC2 capacity, register node on SOCA and start the job Test2 (Pre-Configured): 1 minute 44 seconds to provision EC2 capacity, register host on SOCA and start the job Step 6: Update default AMI (Optional) \u00b6 Single job \u00b6 As you are planning to use a custom AMI, you will be required to specify -l instance_ami=<IMAGE_ID> at job submission. It's recommended to go with the \"Entire Queue\" option below if you do not want to manually specify this resource each time you submit a job Entire queue \u00b6 Edit /apps/soca/$SOCA_CONFIGURATION/cluster_manager/settings/queue_mapping.yml and update the default AMI queue_type : compute : queues : [ \"queue1\" , \"queue2\" , \"queue3\" ] instance_ami : \"<YOUR_AMI_ID>\" # <- Add your new AMI instance_type : ... Any jobs running in the queue configured on the queue_mapping will now use your pre-configured AMI by default. You do not need to specify -l instance_ami at job submission anymore. Entire cluster \u00b6 If you want to change the default AMI to use regardless of queue/job, open your Secret Manager console and select your Scale-Out Computing on AWS cluster configuration. Click \u201cRetrieve Secret Value\u201d and then \u201cEdit\u201d.

To get started, select either \"Linux Desktop\" or \"Windows Desktop\" in the left sidebar. Create your Windows/Linux desktop \u00b6 To launch your Windows/Linux desktop, you first have to pick a name, choose how much storage you want to allocate as well as specify other options such as hibernation support, compute type, software stack or even subnet id. Need help? Hover your mouse on the parameter name to display help section. Once you are ready, click \"Launch My Session\" button. Your session interface will be changed to pending state. Your virtual desktop will be ready within 10-15 minutes. Startup time is based on the image selected, the operating system as well as the instance type. Windows tends to boot faster as some components such as the scheduler or EFS are not installed. Nvidia drivers for GPU instances SOCA automatically install Nvidia GRID (G3/G4) drivers. Tesla drivers (P3) have to be installed separately by the customers. Once your virtual desktop is active, your session interface will display two ways to connect to it: You can either access your desktop directly via your browser (Option1) or use the NICE DCV native application (Option2). A link to download the application is provided on the website. For better performance, we recommend using the Option 2. Example of Linux desktop \u00b6 Example of Windows desktop \u00b6 Important Unlike Linux desktops, Windows desktops are not connected to the scheduler and you cannot submit jobs directly from your Windows system. To submit a job via Windows, you first need to access the web ui then submit a job via HTTP endpoint or via the HTTP REST API Stop/Hibernate your desktop \u00b6 What does hibernate means? When you hibernate an instance, your desktop state is saved in memory. When you restart it, all your applications will automatically resume. On the other hand, stopping a virtual desktop is the same as powering off your laptop. Note not all EC2 instances support hibernation. To stop/hibernate your session, click the \"Stop\" (or \"Hibernate\") button in the top bar. A popup will appear, asking you to confirm your action. Click \"Stop/Hibernate my session\" button to temporarily turn off your virtual desktop. Your desktop is now stopped (you are not charged for compute price while your instance is stopped). To restart your session simply click \"Restart your session\" button. Configure your desktop auto start/stop time \u00b6 To change the schedule of your desktop, click the \"Schedule\" button in the top bar. SOCA will honors your session schedule and automatically start/stop your desktop based on your own schedule. Desktop will be stopped outside of scheduled hours only if they are idle. You can configure three type of schedule for your desktop: Run all day (SOCA will ensures your desktop is up and running from 12 AM to 12 PM) Stopped all day (SOCA will ensures your desktop is stopped from 12 AM to 12 PM) Custom schedule (SOCA will honors your own schedule) Info If you manually start your desktop during off hours, your session will be up and running until it becomes idle. Idle time can be customized by cluster admins. Schedule and Timezone By default, SOCA is configured to use UTC timezone and this may be a problem if you are currently using a different timezone. To fix that, you can adjust your local timezone on config.py (then restart the web ui) Update your hardware requirements on the fly \u00b6 You can upgrade/downgrade the hardware of your desktop only when your session is stopped and if you have disabled hibernation. To do so, click Choose the new type of instance you want to resize your desktop to then click \"Change Instance Type\". Hardware upgrade/downgrade are instant. Your desktop will use the updated config as soon as you restart it. Terminate your desktop \u00b6 To terminate your desktop, click the \"Kill\" button from the menu bar. You will be prompted for a confirmation message. Terminate a session may cause data loss if you are using ephemeral storage, so make sure to have uploaded all your data back to SOCA filesystem first. (Windows only) Retrieve local admin password \u00b6 As of today, Windows desktops are not configured to OpenLDAP, meaning you will use a local Windows account unique to each session. To retrieve the password for the local Administrator account, click \"Get Password\" icon. This will open a new window where you can retrieve the password. Create custom Windows/Linux images \u00b6 SOCA images are Windows or Linux desktops with pre-installed applications. Refer to this page to learn more about images management How idle time is calculated? \u00b6 When you have enabled DCV_LINUX_HIBERNATE_IDLE_SESSION , DCV_LINUX_STOP_IDLE_SESSION , DCV_WINDOWS_HIBERNATE_IDLE_SESSION or DCV_WINDOWS_STOP_IDLE_SESSION configured, SOCA will automatically try to hibernate/stop your idle instance if they are outside of regular schedule hours. Idle time is calculated based on: Last time the user accessed the virtual desktop Current CPUs usage. Session will only be stopped/hibernated if current CPUs is below a threshold configured via DCV_IDLE_CPU_THRESHOLD (default to 15%). This setting avoid desktop being stopped/hibernated while compute intensive tasks are still running on, even if the user did not access the desktop for a while.

Submit a job via REST API In addition of web based job submission, SOCA also supports job management via REST API. Click here to learn more No coding experience = No Problem \u00b6 SOCA features a complete visual form builder experience with simple drag & drop capabilities. HPC admins can build their own forms without any coding/HTML experience via an intuitive wysiwyg (What You See Is What You Get) solution. Build the job script \u00b6 The first step is to identify the variables you want your users to configure. Let's take this simple job file for reference: #PBS -N MyJobName #PBS -P MyJobProject #PBS -q queue_1 #PBS -l instance_type=c5.18xlarge # CD into current working directory cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR # Prepare the job environment, edit the current PATH, License Server etc export PATH = /apps/softwarename/v2020/ export LICENSE_SERVER = 1234 @licenseserver.internal # Run the solver /apps/softwarename/v2020/bin/solver --cpus 36 \\ --input-file myfile.input \\ --parameter1 value1 # Once job is complete, archive output to S3 BACKUP = 1 if [[ \" $BACKUP \" -eq 1 ]] ; then aws s3 sync . s3://mybucketname/ fi Replace the values/parameters you want your users to configure with %VARIABLE_NAME% such as: #PBS -N %job_name% #PBS -P %job_project% # I do not want my user to be able to change the queue #PBS -q myqueue #PBS -l instance_type=%instance_type% # CD into current working directory cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR # Prepare the job environment, edit the current PATH, License Server etc export PATH = /apps/softwarename/%version%/ export LICENSE_SERVER = 1234 @licenseserver.internal # Run the solver /apps/softwarename/%version%/bin/solver --cpus %cpus% \\ --input-file %input_file% \\ --parameter1 %parameter1% # Once job is complete, archive output to S3 BACKUP = %backup_enabled% if [[ \" $BACKUP \" -eq 1 ]] ; then aws s3 sync . s3://%bucket_to_archive%/ fi In this example: %job_name% will be replaced by the actual job name specified by the user %job_project% will be replaced by the project associated to the job %version% will let the user decide what software version to use %cpus% , %input_file%, and %parameter1% are application specific parameters %backup_enabled% will determine if we want to archive the job output to S3 %bucket_to_archive% will point to the user's personal S3 bucket Create the HTML form \u00b6 Now that you have identified all variables, you must create their associated HTML components. As a HPC admin, navigate to \"Application Management\" tab and start to build the HTML form. %job_name% , %job_project%, %bucket_to_archive%, %input_file% and %parameter1% \u00b6 Drag \"Text Field\" component from the left section to add it to the form. Configure the widget and configure the Name settings (red) with the variable name associated (job_name in our example) In the example below, the value entered by the user for job_name will be sent to the job script and retrieved via %job_name% Repeat the same operation for %job_project%, %bucket_to_archive%, %parameter1% and %input_file% Note %input_file% will automatically be configured with the path of the input file selected by the user %instance_type% \u00b6 We want to enforce the instance type to be c5.18xlarge. To do that, you can simply hardcode the information on the job script or create a \"Hidden Input\" parameter. The red section references to the variable name and the green section is the variable value. %cpus% \u00b6 For %cpus% variable, we recommend using the \"Number\" component Specify a name which match your variable name (red), pick the default value (green) then choose the Min/Max/Step values allowed (blue) %version% \u00b6 Assuming your application hierarchy is as follow: \u2514\u2500\u2500 /apps \u2514\u2500\u2500 /softwarename \u251c\u2500\u2500 v2020 \u251c\u2500\u2500 v2019 \u2514\u2500\u2500 v2018 This time, we recommend you using the \"Select\" component: Similarly to the previous examples, check the \"Required\" checkbox, map the \"Name\" to your variable name (%version%) and add labels (green) and their associated values (blue) Note Use autocomplete if you have a large number of entry %backup_enabled% \u00b6 %backup_enabled% is a boolean which enable (1) or disable (0) archival of the job output data to S3. This time use \"Radio Group\" component and configure the different values: Configure the job script \u00b6 Once your HTML form is done, simply click \"Step2\" and copy/paste your job script Select your interpreter Since this script is expected to be triggered by PBS, keep the default \"will use qsub\" option. Save your profile \u00b6 Finally, navigate to step3, choose an name, upload a thumbnail if needed (optional) and click \"Create this application\" Submit a test job \u00b6 To submit a job, first navigate to \"Submit Job (Web)\" on the left sidebar. Choose your input file and click \"Use as Simulation input\" icon Select the application you want to run Fill out the HTML form generated during the previous step with your own inputs. Real time cost estimate The cost of your simulation is calculated in real-time based on the resources you are specifying Nodes Count SOCA also determine the number of nodes to provision automatically based on the instance type and cpus requested. In this example, the instance is c5.18xlarge (36 cores) and the number of CPUs requested by the user is 72. SOCA automatically detect these values and determine the number of instances to provision is 2 Once done, click \"Submit Job\" and you job will be submitted to the queue. Inputs sanitization SOCA automatically sanitize your inputs when required (remove space, special characters etc ...). In this example, the job name specified was \"My Super Job\" and was corrected to \"MySuperJob\" due some scheduler limitations. You can verify the input file generated by clicking \"Job Directory\": Then select \"View or Edit this File\" icon (3 rd from the left) This will open the submit file created by the web form. You can verify the output generated by your form is correct and/or troubleshoot any potential issue Delete job \u00b6 To delete a job, simply navigate to \"My Job Queue\" section and click on the \"Kill\" button What if I want to run a Linux script/command \u00b6 If you want your job script to use regular bash interpreter (and not qsub), simple select \"This is a Linux script\".

The example workload is a CPU- and IO-intensive logic simulation that is found in integrated cicuit design workflows. Step 1: Submit jobs to the scheduler \u00b6 Next, you'll submit four jobs into the cluster, each job requests a specific instance type. Using multiple instance types will help provide more interesting data to look at in the analytics lab. Execute the run_tests.sh script by typing ./run_tests.sh then hit enter. The script is broken into two sections: The first section creates 5 compute instances each with 4 vCPUs then the second section submits 20 batch jobs to these instances. You'll observe that the PBS scheduler will report the corresponding job ids for each of these 20 jobs. You can examine the run_tests.sh script by typing cat run_tests.sh . Notice that we're using Spot pricing model since the duration of these jobs are short. Also, notice that we're specifying --terminate_when_idle 3 which would terminate the instances and remove them from the cluster 3 mins after all jobs running on the instances complete. Step 2: Watch job status \u00b6 Run the qstat command to view the status of the jobs. You can also view job status by clicking on My Job Queue in the left side navigation bar in SOCA portal under PROFILE section as shown in the screen shot below: The result should be similar to the screen shot below which is a table format showing job id, name, status, etc...: You can run the pbsnodes -aSjL command to see the EC2 instances that have joined the cluster. Initially, the nodes will be in state-unknown,down till they boot-up and join the queue. Note SOCA automation scripts are configured to monitor the status of the queues every minute. It typically takes 5-6 minutes to launch a new EC2 instance, boot the operating system, configure it to join the cluster, and have the assigned job to start running. Step 3: Monitor test20 job \u00b6 Monitor the status of test20 job by refreshing the My Job Queue page in SOCA portal and look for the Status column for the job with test20 under Name column. You can also monitor the status of the jobs in the terminal by typing watch -n 10 \"qstat -u `whoami`\" command which will keep monitoring the status of the jobs every 10 seconds. You'll need to wait for the S column represeting the status of the job correspoding to the one with test20 under Name column. This job usually takes around 10 minutes to complete.

Create an AWS Budget \u00b6 Go to the AWS Billing Dashboard , and click Budgets on the left sidebar. Click Create budget . Select Cost budget and click Set your budget . Name your budget \"Project 1\" and set Budgeted amount to $100 . Leave all other fields at their default values. Click Configure alerts . Set Alert threshold to 80 and add an email address to Email contacts . Click Confirm budget to review the configuration, then click Create . Step 2. Enable budget enforcement \u00b6 Next, you will enable the workload scheduler to be aware of the new budget you just created so that it will reject jobs from users who are not members of a project and associated budget. To enable this feature, you will first need to verify the project assigned to each job during submission time. Find the account ID for your temporary AWS account. Click here to go to the Account page of the AWS console. Copy the twelve digit Account Id number located underneath the Account Settings section. Log back into the scheduler instance via SSH and edit the /apps/soca/cluster_hooks/queuejob/check_project_budget.py script and paste the AWS account ID as the value for the aws_account_id variable. Save the file when done. # User Variables aws_account_id = '<ENTER_YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>' budget_config_file = '/apps/soca/cluster_manager/settings/project_cost_manager.txt' Enable the integration with the scheduler by running the following commands on the scheduler host: sudo -i source /etc/environment qmgr -c \"create hook check_project_budget event=queuejob\" qmgr -c \"import hook check_project_budget application/x-python default /apps/soca/cluster_hooks/queuejob/check_project_budget.py\" Step 3. Test budget enforcement \u00b6 Submit a job without budget assignment \u00b6 Switch to the admin cluster user. sudo su - admin Submit a job. qsub -- /bin/echo Hello This job will be rejected and you will see the following messages: qsub: Error. You tried to submit job without project. Specify project using -P parameter OK, let's add a project tag to comply with the policy. qsub -P \"Project 1\" -- /bin/echo Hello This job will also be rejected: qsub: User morrmt is not assigned to any project. See /apps/soca/cluster_manager/settings/project_cost_manager.txt Next, we'll associated the user with \"Project 1\" by adding the username to the project_cost_manager.txt mapping file. As sudo, open the /apps/soca/cluster_manager/settings/project_cost_manager.txt file and add \"Project 1\" budget and the \"admin\" user. # This file is used to prevent job submission when budget allocated to a project exceed your threshold # This file is not used by default and must be configured manually using /apps/soca/cluster_hooks/queuejob/check_project_budget.py # Help & Documentation: https://soca.dev/tutorials/set-up-budget-project/ # # # Syntax: # [project 1] # user1 # user2 # [project 2] # user1 # user3 # [project blabla] # user4 # user5 [Project 1] admin Important The config section (\"Project 1\") must match the name of the budget your created in AWS Budgets (it's case sensitive) Save this file and try to submit a job.

To prevent over-spending, you can integrate the scheduler with AWS Budgets to take action when customer-defined budget thesholds have been reached. In this example, we will reject job submissions from users who are not assigned to a project that is associated with an AWS Budget . Step 1. Create an AWS Budget \u00b6 Go to the AWS Billing Dashboard , and click Budgets on the left sidebar. Click Create budget . Select Cost budget and click Set your budget . Name your budget \"Project 1\" and set Budgeted amount to $100 . Leave all other fields at their default values. Click Configure alerts . Set Alert threshold to 80 and add an email address to Email contacts . Click Confirm budget to review the configuration, then click Create . Step 2. Enable budget enforcement \u00b6 Next, you will enable the workload scheduler to be aware of the new budget you just created so that it will reject jobs from users who are not members of a project and associated budget. To enable this feature, you will first need to verify the project assigned to each job during submission time. Find the account ID for your temporary AWS account. Click here to go to the Account page of the AWS console. Copy the twelve digit Account Id number located underneath the Account Settings section. Log back into the scheduler instance via SSH and edit the /apps/soca/cluster_hooks/queuejob/check_project_budget.py script and paste the AWS account ID as the value for the aws_account_id variable. Save the file when done. # User Variables aws_account_id = '<ENTER_YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>' budget_config_file = '/apps/soca/cluster_manager/settings/project_cost_manager.txt' Enable the integration with the scheduler by running the following commands on the scheduler host: sudo -i source /etc/environment qmgr -c \"create hook check_project_budget event=queuejob\" qmgr -c \"import hook check_project_budget application/x-python default /apps/soca/cluster_hooks/queuejob/check_project_budget.py\" Step 3.

Click here to go to the Account page of the AWS console. Copy the twelve digit Account Id number located underneath the Account Settings section. Log back into the scheduler instance via SSH and edit the /apps/soca/cluster_hooks/queuejob/check_project_budget.py script and paste the AWS account ID as the value for the aws_account_id variable.
